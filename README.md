# up221-Aneesa : Data Science Project
## Winter 2024

I am currently a first year PhD student with the Institute of Environment and Sutainability. My research interests lie primarily in managing freshwater resources. I plan to further research water as a human right, drought, agriculture, and governance of freshwater in California during my time here at UCLA. I have some coding background, but I am eager to aquire more skills in this course,.

My goal is to use spatial data science and GIS to expose envitonmental injustice areas. In doing so, I plan on using multiple data sets to reveal areas that are left vulnerable to environmental disasters. Through GIS mapping, readers can be shown the great impact infrastructure, race, gender, and economic standing can have on communities.
