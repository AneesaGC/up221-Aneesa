# up221-Aneesa : Data Science Project
## Winter 2024

My goal is to use spatial data science and GIS to expose envitonmental injustice areas. In doing so, I plan on using multiple data sets to reveal areas that are left vulnerable to environmental disasters. Through GIS mapping, readers can be shown the great impact infrastructure, race, gender, and economic standing can have on communities.
